# skweak (scikit-weakly-supervised)
 A package featuring utilities and algorithms for weakly supervised ML.
 Should be (more-or-less) compatible with scikit-learn!
 It collects original algorithms and methods developed at the MUDI lab (DISCo dept., University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy),
 as well as some algorithms available in the literature. Some references:
